        "Weighing all my options, I had decided in the mid of 2012 to pursue my graduation from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur. During this process of making life changing decisions and applying for desired colleges / streams for graduation, I always knew I’d be getting out of the college  with a B. Tech. degree, hopefully in four years. But I never realized I was going to spend this time building thousands of memories that I could later cherish.",
        "First year, we’d started to settle in. Everything that we’d need then was inside the college campus. The hostel and the mess, the canteen, the shops, the Xerox place. The first year hostel was a guarded fortress. There were also a bunch of strict rules that we had to follow as freshers. For instance, we had to be back in our hostels by 8 p.m., lights out by 10. But with time, we’d found our ways around them. I remember breaking out of the hostel at midnight and walking around ten kilometers just to grab a snack. Ragging was prohibited, but seniors grabbed any opportunities they could find. Sure, the process was embarrassing, but that’s how we later built a lasting relationship with them. Various fests were organized in the college which saw a huge participation from the first years. And before we realized, it was time of our viva and exams. We were neck deep into lectures studying courses very remotely related to our specializations. But with time, all this became normal routine for us.",
